## Flight Simulation and WebGL Textures

View [demo](./index.html).

Uses random faulting to auto generate a texture-mapped terrain with a first person POV flight simulation (flight flying over the terrain) with user controlled camera movement.
    1.  arrow "up, down, left, right"  keys -> to rotate (turn) the camera for roll, pitch, yaw.
    2.  "W, A, S, D" keys -> to move the camera forwards, backwards, left and right.

Load and texture map an .OBJ file.

Toggle Fog (weather phenomenon) simulation via fragment shader - Using "F" key.
