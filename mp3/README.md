Generating a 3D Model of an arbitrary landscape terrain using random fault generation (aka the faulting method) via <i>[A Review of Digital Terrain Modeling. Eric Galin, Eric Gu√©rin, Adrien Peytavie, et al](https://hal.science/hal-02097510/file/A%20Review%20of%20Digital%20Terrain%20Modeling.pdf)</i>.

This includes creation of a randomized terrain via random faulting (user provided number of faults and fractures). Also includes illumination via diffuse and specular [lighting models](https://cs418.cs.illinois.edu/website/text/lighting.html).

The simulation of generated terrain under severe weathering is tested via algorithmic spherical erosion.
