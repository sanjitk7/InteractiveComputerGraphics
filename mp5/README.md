## Particle Effects with WebGL

View [demo](./burst.html).

Simulation of physical particle effects - done via placing 50 spheres of varying mass rendered using a single sphere geometry withing an invisible bounding box in randomized locations, illuminated with diffuse lighting and move according to momentum, gravity and experience drag. The spheres experience collisions with the other spheres and the bounding box. The simulation resets every 20 seconds.
